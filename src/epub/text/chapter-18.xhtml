			</hgroup>
			<p>“Women,” said Psmith, helping himself to trifle, and speaking with the air of one launched upon his special subject, “are, one must recollect, like⁠—like⁠—er, well, in fact, just so. Passing on lightly from that conclusion, let us turn for a moment to the Rights of Property, in connection with which Comrade Prebble and yourself had so much that was interesting to say this afternoon. Perhaps you”⁠—he bowed in Comrade Prebble’s direction⁠—“would resume, for the benefit of Comrade Jackson⁠—a novice in the Cause, but earnest⁠—your very lucid⁠—”</p>
			<p>Comrade Prebble beamed, and took the floor. Mike began to realize that, till now, he had never known what boredom meant. There had been moments in his life which had been less interesting than other moments, but nothing to touch this for agony. Comrade Prebble’s address streamed on like water rushing over a weir. Every now and then there was a word or two which was recognizable, but this happened so rarely that it amounted to little. Sometimes <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Waller would interject a remark, but not often. He seemed to be of the opinion that Comrade Prebble’s was the master mind and that to add anything to his views would be in the nature of painting the lily and gilding the refined gold. Mike himself said nothing. Psmith and Edward were equally silent. The former sat like one in a trance, thinking his own thoughts, while Edward, who, prospecting on the sideboard, had located a rich biscuit-mine, was too occupied for speech.</p>
			<p>After about twenty minutes, during which Mike’s discomfort changed to a dull resignation, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Waller suggested a move to the drawing-room, where Ada, he said, would play some hymns.</p>
			<p>The prospect did not dazzle Mike, but any change, he thought, must be for the better. He had sat staring at the ruin of the blancmange so long that it had begun to hypnotize him. Also, the move had the excellent result of eliminating the snub-nosed Edward, who was sent to bed. His last words were in the form of a question, addressed to Mike, on the subject of the hypotenuse and the square upon the same.</p>
			<p>“A remarkably intelligent boy,” said Psmith. “You must let him come to tea at our flat one day. I may not be in myself⁠—I have many duties which keep me away⁠—but Comrade Jackson is sure to be there, and will be delighted to chat with him.”</p>
			<p>On the way upstairs Mike tried to get Psmith to himself for a moment to suggest the advisability of an early departure; but Psmith was in close conversation with his host. Mike was left to Comrade Prebble, who, apparently, had only touched the fringe of his subject in his lecture in the dining room.</p>
			<p>When <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Waller had predicted hymns in the drawing-room, he had been too sanguine (or too pessimistic). Of Ada, when they arrived, there were no signs. It seemed that she had gone straight to bed. Young <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Richards was sitting on the sofa, moodily turning the leaves of a photograph album, which contained portraits of Master Edward Waller in geometrically progressing degrees of repulsiveness⁠—here, in frocks, looking like a gargoyle; there, in sailor suit, looking like nothing on earth. The inspection of these was obviously deepening <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Richards’ gloom, but he proceeded doggedly with it.</p>
			<p>Comrade Prebble backed the reluctant Mike into a corner, and, like the Ancient Mariner, held him with a glittering eye. Psmith and <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Waller, in the opposite corner, were looking at something with their heads close together. Mike definitely abandoned all hope of a rescue from Psmith, and tried to buoy himself up with the reflection that this could not last forever.</p>
			<p>Hours seemed to pass, and then at last he heard Psmith’s voice saying goodbye to his host.</p>
			<p>He sprang to his feet. Comrade Prebble was in the middle of a sentence, but this was no time for polished courtesy. He felt that he must get away, and at once. “I fear,” Psmith was saying, “that we must tear ourselves away. We have greatly enjoyed our evening. You must look us up at our flat one day, and bring Comrade Prebble. If I am not in, Comrade Jackson is certain to be, and he will be more than delighted to hear Comrade Prebble speak further on the subject of which he is such a master.” Comrade Prebble was understood to say that he would certainly come. <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Waller beamed. <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Richards, still steeped in gloom, shook hands in silence.</p>
			<p>Out in the road, with the front door shut behind them, Mike spoke his mind.</p>
			<p>“Look here, Smith,” he said definitely, “if being your confidential secretary and adviser is going to let me in for any more of that sort of thing, you can jolly well accept my resignation.”</p>
			<p>“The orgy was not to your taste?” said Psmith sympathetically.</p>
			<p>Mike laughed. One of those short, hollow, bitter laughs.</p>
			<p>“I am at a loss, Comrade Jackson,” said Psmith, “to understand your attitude. You fed sumptuously. You had fun with the crockery⁠—that knockabout act of yours with the water jug was alone worth the money⁠—and you had the advantage of listening to the views of a master of his subject. What more do you want?”</p>
			<p>“What on earth did you land me with that man Prebble for?”</p>
			<p>“Land you! Why, you courted his society. I had practically to drag you away from him. When I got up to say goodbye, you were listening to him with bulging eyes. I never saw such a picture of rapt attention. Do you mean to tell me, Comrade Jackson, that your appearance belied you, that you were not interested? Well, well. How we misread our fellow creatures.”</p>
			<p>“I think you might have come and lent a hand with Prebble. It was a bit thick.”</p>
			<p>“I was too absorbed with Comrade Waller. We were talking of things of vital moment. However, the night is yet young. We will take this cab, wend our way to the West, seek a café, and cheer ourselves with light refreshments.”</p>
			<p>Arrived at a café whose window appeared to be a sort of museum of every kind of German sausage, they took possession of a vacant table and ordered coffee. Mike soon found himself soothed by his bright surroundings, and gradually his impressions of blancmange, Edward, and Comrade Prebble faded from his mind. Psmith, meanwhile, was preserving an unusual silence, being deep in a large square book of the sort in which Press cuttings are pasted. As Psmith scanned its contents a curious smile lit up his face. His reflections seemed to be of an agreeable nature.</p>
			<p>“Hullo,” said Mike, “what have you got hold of there? Where did you get that?”</p>
			<p>“Comrade Waller very kindly lent it to me. He showed it to me after supper, knowing how enthusiastically I was attached to the Cause. Had you been less tensely wrapped up in Comrade Prebble’s conversation, I would have desired you to step across and join us. However, you now have your opportunity.”</p>
			<p>“But what is it?” asked Mike.</p>
			<p>“It is the record of the meetings of the Tulse Hill Parliament,” said Psmith impressively. “A faithful record of all they said, all the votes of confidence they passed in the Government, and also all the nasty knocks they gave it from time to time.”</p>
			<p>“What on earth’s the Tulse Hill Parliament?”</p>
			<p>“It is, alas,” said Psmith in a grave, sad voice, “no more. In life it was beautiful, but now it has done the Tom Bowling act. It has gone aloft. We are dealing, Comrade Jackson, not with the live, vivid present, but with the far-off, rusty past. And yet, in a way, there is a touch of the live, vivid present mixed up in it.”</p>
			<p>“I don’t know what the dickens you’re talking about,” said Mike. “Let’s have a look, anyway.”</p>
			<p>Psmith handed him the volume, and, leaning back, sipped his coffee, and watched him. At first Mike’s face was bored and blank, but suddenly an interested look came into it.</p>
			<p>“Aha!” said Psmith.</p>
			<p>“Who’s Bickersdyke? Anything to do with our Bickersdyke?”</p>
			<p>“No other than our genial friend himself.”</p>
			<p>Mike turned the pages, reading a line or two on each.</p>
			<p>“Hullo!” he said, chuckling. “He lets himself go a bit, doesn’t he!”</p>
			<p>“He does,” acknowledged Psmith. “A fiery, passionate nature, that of Comrade Bickersdyke.”</p>
			<p>“He’s simply cursing the Government here. Giving them frightful beans.”</p>
			<p>Psmith nodded.</p>
			<p>“I noticed the fact myself.”</p>
			<p>“But what’s it all about?”</p>
			<p>“As far as I can glean from Comrade Waller,” said Psmith, “about twenty years ago, when he and Comrade Bickersdyke worked hand-in-hand as fellow clerks at the New Asiatic, they were both members of the Tulse Hill Parliament, that powerful institution. At that time Comrade Bickersdyke was as fruity a Socialist as Comrade Waller is now. Only, apparently, as he began to get on a bit in the world, he altered his views to some extent as regards the iniquity of freezing on to a decent share of the doubloons. And that, you see, is where the dim and rusty past begins to get mixed up with the live, vivid present. If any tactless person were to publish those very able speeches made by Comrade Bickersdyke when a bulwark of the Tulse Hill Parliament, our revered chief would be more or less caught bending, if I may employ the expression, as regards his chances of getting in as Unionist candidate at Kenningford. You follow me, Watson? I rather fancy the lighthearted electors of Kenningford, from what I have seen of their rather acute sense of humour, would be, as it were, all over it. It would be very, very trying for Comrade Bickersdyke if these speeches of his were to get about.”</p>
			<p>“You aren’t going to⁠—!”</p>
			<p>“I shall do nothing rashly. I shall merely place this handsome volume among my treasured books. I shall add it to my ‘Books that have helped me’ series. Because I fancy that, in an emergency, it may not be at all a bad thing to have about me. And now,” he concluded, “as the hour is getting late, perhaps we had better be shoving off for home.”</p>
