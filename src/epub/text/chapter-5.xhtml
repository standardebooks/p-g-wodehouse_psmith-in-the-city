			<p>As Bannister had said, the work in the postage department was not intricate. There was nothing much to do except enter and stamp letters, and, at intervals, take them down to the post office at the end of the street. The nature of the work gave Mike plenty of time for reflection.</p>
			<p>His thoughts became gloomy again. All this was very far removed from the life to which he had looked forward. There are some people who take naturally to a life of commerce. Mike was not of these. To him the restraint of the business was irksome. He had been used to an open-air life, and a life, in its way, of excitement. He gathered that he would not be free till five o’clock, and that on the following day he would come at ten and go at five, and the same every day, except Saturdays and Sundays, all the year round, with a ten days’ holiday. The monotony of the prospect appalled him. He was not old enough to know what a narcotic is Habit, and that one can become attached to and interested in the most unpromising jobs. He worked away dismally at his letters till he had finished them. Then there was nothing to do except sit and wait for more.</p>
			<p>He looked through the letters he had stamped, and reread the addresses. Some of them were directed to people living in the country, one to a house which he knew quite well, near to his own home in Shropshire. It made him homesick, conjuring up visions of shady gardens and country sounds and smells, and the silver Severn gleaming in the distance through the trees. About now, if he were not in this dismal place, he would be lying in the shade in the garden with a book, or wandering down to the river to boat or bathe. That envelope addressed to the man in Shropshire gave him the worst moment he had experienced that day.</p>
			<p>The time crept slowly on to one o’clock. At two minutes past Mike awoke from a daydream to find <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Waller standing by his side. The cashier had his hat on.</p>
			<p>“I wonder,” said <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Waller, “if you would care to come out to lunch. I generally go about this time, and <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Rossiter, I know, does not go out till two. I thought perhaps that, being unused to the City, you might have some difficulty in finding your way about.”</p>
			<p>“It’s awfully good of you,” said Mike. “I should like to.”</p>
			<p>The other led the way through the streets and down obscure alleys till they came to a chophouse. Here one could have the doubtful pleasure of seeing one’s chop in its various stages of evolution. <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Waller ordered lunch with the care of one to whom lunch is no slight matter. Few workers in the City do regard lunch as a trivial affair. It is the keynote of their day. It is an oasis in a desert of ink and ledgers. Conversation in city office deals, in the morning, with what one is going to have for lunch, and in the afternoon with what one has had for lunch.</p>
			<p>At intervals during the meal <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Waller talked. Mike was content to listen. There was something soothing about the grey-bearded one.</p>
			<p>“What sort of a man is Bickersdyke?” asked Mike.</p>
			<p>“A very able man. A very able man indeed. I’m afraid he’s not popular in the office. A little inclined, perhaps, to be hard on mistakes. I can remember the time when he was quite different. He and I were fellow clerks in Morton and Blatherwick’s. He got on better than I did. A great fellow for getting on. They say he is to be the Unionist candidate for Kenningford when the time comes. A great worker, but perhaps not quite the sort of man to be generally popular in an office.”</p>
			<p>“He’s a blighter,” was Mike’s verdict. <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Waller made no comment. Mike was to learn later that the manager and the cashier, despite the fact that they had been together in less prosperous days⁠—or possibly because of it⁠—were not on very good terms. <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Bickersdyke was a man of strong prejudices, and he disliked the cashier, whom he looked down upon as one who had climbed to a lower rung of the ladder than he himself had reached.</p>
			<p>As the hands of the chophouse clock reached a quarter to two, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Waller rose, and led the way back to the office, where they parted for their respective desks. Gratitude for any good turn done to him was a leading characteristic of Mike’s nature, and he felt genuinely grateful to the cashier for troubling to seek him out and be friendly to him.</p>
			<p>His three-quarters-of-an-hour absence had led to the accumulation of a small pile of letters on his desk. He sat down and began to work them off. The addresses continued to exercise a fascination for him. He was miles away from the office, speculating on what sort of a man <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">J. B.</abbr> Garside, <abbr>Esq.</abbr>, was, and whether he had a good time at his house in Worcestershire, when somebody tapped him on the shoulder.</p>
			<p>He looked up.</p>
			<p>Standing by his side, immaculately dressed as ever, with his eyeglass fixed and a gentle smile on his face, was Psmith.</p>
			<p>Mike stared.</p>
			<p>“Commerce,” said Psmith, as he drew off his lavender gloves, “has claimed me for her own. Comrade of old, I, too, have joined this blighted institution.”</p>
			<p>As he spoke, there was a whirring noise in the immediate neighbourhood, and <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Rossiter buzzed out from his den with the esprit and animation of a clockwork toy.</p>
			<p>“Who’s here?” said Psmith with interest, removing his eyeglass, polishing it, and replacing it in his eye.</p>
			<p>“<abbr>Mr.</abbr> Jackson,” exclaimed <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Rossiter. “I really must ask you to be good enough to come in from your lunch at the proper time. It was fully seven minutes to two when you returned, and⁠—”</p>
			<p>“That little more,” sighed Psmith, “and how much is it!”</p>
			<p>“Who are you?” snapped <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Rossiter, turning on him.</p>
			<p>“I shall be delighted, Comrade⁠—”</p>
			<p>“Rossiter,” said Mike, aside.</p>
			<p>“Comrade Rossiter. I shall be delighted to furnish you with particulars of my family history. As follows. Soon after the Norman Conquest, a certain Sieur de Psmith grew tired of work⁠—a family failing, alas!⁠—and settled down in this country to live peacefully for the remainder of his life on what he could extract from the local peasantry. He may be described as the founder of the family which ultimately culminated in Me. Passing on⁠—”</p>
			<p><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Rossiter refused to pass on.</p>
			<p>“What are you doing here? What have you come for?”</p>
			<p>“Work,” said Psmith, with simple dignity. “I am now a member of the staff of this bank. Its interests are my interests. Psmith, the individual, ceases to exist, and there springs into being Psmith, the cog in the wheel of the New Asiatic Bank; Psmith, the link in the bank’s chain; Psmith, the Worker. I shall not spare myself,” he proceeded earnestly. “I shall toil with all the accumulated energy of one who, up till now, has only known what work is like from hearsay. Whose is that form sitting on the steps of the bank in the morning, waiting eagerly for the place to open? It is the form of Psmith, the Worker. Whose is that haggard, drawn face which bends over a ledger long after the other toilers have sped blithely westwards to dine at Lyons’ Popular Café? It is the face of Psmith, the Worker.”</p>
			<p>“I⁠—” began <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Rossiter.</p>
			<p>“I tell you,” continued Psmith, waving aside the interruption and tapping the head of the department rhythmically in the region of the second waistcoat-button with a long finger, “I tell <em>you</em>, Comrade Rossiter, that you have got hold of a good man. You and I together, not forgetting Comrade Jackson, the pet of the Smart Set, will toil early and late till we boost up this Postage Department into a shining model of what a Postage Department should be. What that is, at present, I do not exactly know. However. Excursion trains will be run from distant shires to see this Postage Department. American visitors to London will do it before going on to the Tower. And now,” he broke off, with a crisp, businesslike intonation, “I must ask you to excuse me. Much as I have enjoyed this little chat, I fear it must now cease. The time has come to work. Our trade rivals are getting ahead of us. The whisper goes round, ‘Rossiter and Psmith are talking, not working,’ and other firms prepare to pinch our business. Let me Work.”</p>
			<p>Two minutes later, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Rossiter was sitting at his desk with a dazed expression, while Psmith, perched gracefully on a stool, entered figures in a ledger.</p>
